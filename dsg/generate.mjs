/**
 * ROLE VALUES → THE PACKAGE YOU DOWNLOAD.
 *
 * This is the deliverable, and the only thing that has to be true: unzip it,
 * follow install.md, and the kits you picked are wearing your values. A theme
 * editor that produces a pretty screen and a broken zip has produced nothing.
 *
 * Each kit gets its theme in ITS OWN form — Tailwind's @theme, daisyUI's
 * @plugin block, shadcn's :root, Bootstrap's variables plus a Sass line,
 * Material's tokens plus its generator. We do not normalise those into a shape
 * of ours; the whole point is that what you copy is what that kit expects.
 *
 * And the manifest carries what could NOT be done, by name. A package that
 * quietly leaves out a third of a theme is worse than one that says so.

# ${name}

## Overview

${overview.trim() || `No brand description was written. This system is defined by its values, not by a
mood — ${stack} with the colours, type and shape below.`}

## Colors

Every colour here is written into a variable ${stack.includes('+') ? 'those kits publish' : 'that kit publishes'};
none of them is a name invented for this file.
${warnings.length ? `\n${warnings.join('\n')}\n` : ''}
## Typography

${values.fontHeading ? `Headings are set in ${values.fontHeading}.\nBody text is set in ${values.fontBody ?? values.fontHeading}.` : 'No family was chosen; the kit\'s own stack is in use.'}
${webs.length ? `\n${webs.map((f) => `**${f.family}**`).join(' and ')} must be fetched. Put this in the document head,
or every measurement in this file is off:

\`\`\`html
${fontLink(webs.map((f) => f.family))}
\`\`\`
` : ''}
## Layout

${spacing.length
  ? `Every gap, padding and margin in this stack is a multiple of \`spacing.base\`. Use the
kit's own spacing utilities rather than a pixel value.`
  : `This stack names no spacing scale. Use the kit's own spacing utilities and keep them
consistent; do not introduce a scale of your own.`}

## Elevation & Depth

${depth}

## Shapes

${has('radius')
  ? `One radius, \`rounded.md\` at ${values.radius}. The kit scales its own smaller and larger
corners from it, so use its named radii rather than a literal.`
  : 'No radius was set; the kit\'s own corners are in use.'}

## Components

The components come from ${stack}. Use them. Do not write a new button, card or
input: one already exists, and the values above are what it reads.
${parts.length ? `\nThe wall this system was checked against covers: ${parts.join(', ')}.` : ''}
${gaps.length ? `\n${gaps.map(([, part, why]) => `- **${part}** — ${why}.`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Never write a raw hex, radius or font size.** Every one of them is a variable
  in \`theme.css\`, in the vocabulary of the kit you are rendering with.
- **Never add a second UI library.** If something is missing, compose it from the
  components above and the values in this file.
${warnings.map((w) => `- ${w}`).join('\n')}
${gaps.map(([kit, part]) => `- **Do not install a dependency for a ${part}.** ${kit} ships none on purpose; build it from the parts above.`).join('\n')}
- **This project may already contain colours, radii and font sizes that are not in
  this file.** Replace them with the nearest role here. Do not keep a value because
  it is already in the code.
- **If this system cannot express something you need, say so** rather than inventing
  it. \`MANIFEST.md\` lists what could not be set and why.
