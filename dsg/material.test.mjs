/**
 * The rule that keeps Material honest: every element the binding emits must be
 * one Google's package declares AND one our bundle actually registers.
 *
 * A tag that is theirs by name but missing from the bundle renders as an
 * unknown inline element — it would look like a hole in Material's kit, and the
 * hole would be ours. That is exactly the failure this kit spent months being.
 *
 * First run reads the package (an npm install); after that it is cached.
