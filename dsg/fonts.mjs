/**
 * THE FONTS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM — read, not curated.
 *
 * A design system generator with no opinion of its own cannot ship a list of
 * "good fonts". So it does not. There are exactly two published sources here:
 *
 *   · the families the kits themselves publish — every kit names a default
 *     stack, and Open Props publishes fifty-six of them (transitional, humanist,
 *     old-style, industrial …). These are system stacks: nothing to download.
 *   · Google Fonts, from Google's own metadata endpoint. 1900-odd families with
 *     their category and popularity, no key, no curation by us. A family from
 *     here is a download, and the export says so.
 *
 * Cached in kits/fonts.json because it is a 2.7 MB fetch; --refresh re-reads it.
