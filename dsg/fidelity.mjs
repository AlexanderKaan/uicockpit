/**
 * HOW MUCH OF EACH KIT IS REALLY THEIRS.
 *
 * The claim is not "it looks like daisyUI". The claim is that it IS daisyUI —
 * their classes, their stylesheet, their component. Ninety-nine percent is not
 * a weaker version of that claim, it is a different claim, and one we would not
 * be allowed to make.
 *
 * So this counts. Every class our binding emits for a kit is looked up in that
 * kit's OWN compiled stylesheet. A class their CSS does not define is a class we
 * invented, and every one of them is printed by name.
 *
 * Tailwind is exempt from the component half by construction: it ships
 * utilities, not components, so there is nothing there to be 100% of. That is
 * said out loud rather than scored as a pass.
