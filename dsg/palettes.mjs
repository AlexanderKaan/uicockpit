/**
 * THE PALETTES YOUR STACK ALREADY PUBLISHES.
 *
 * Ten colour pickers is a fine way to adjust a palette and a terrible way to
 * start one. What people want first is a family — "make it teal" — and the
 * temptation is to ship a handful of nice ones. That would be a palette opinion,
 * which is the one thing this tool may not have.
 *
 * It does not need one. Tailwind publishes seventeen colour families of eleven
 * steps. Radix publishes thirty-one hand-built twelve-step scales AND says what
 * each step is for. Open Props publishes sixteen, Mantine twelve. So a palette
 * here is one of theirs, and switching kits switches which are on offer.
 *
 * Nothing below is a list. Families are FOUND in what a kit publishes, split
 * into accents and neutrals by their own chroma, and the roles are read out of
 * the ramp — the extremes by position, the middle two by contrast against a
 * published standard.

 * somebody liked, a green somebody picked. We are not allowed one, and it turns
 * out we do not need one: the kits in the stack have already published every
 * relationship this needs.
 *
 *   the brand      is yours, exactly. It is the one thing you said.
 *   the greys      are the neutral ramp your stack publishes whose HUE sits
 *                  closest to yours — Radix's own "auto", generalised — and the
 *                  page, surface, ink, muted ink and line are read out of it the
 *                  same way a family is.
 *   the semantics  are the kit's OWN green, amber and red, each moved by the
 *                  step your brand takes from theirs: same hue, your lightness
 *                  difference, your chroma ratio. A quiet brand gets a quiet
 *                  red. That is the rule this project keeps arriving at — read
 *                  their published pair, take the relationship out of it, put
 *                  your value through it — for the fifth time.
 *   the focus ring is your brand, unless a kit in the stack publishes one.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented, and `derived` says which kit answered for what, so
 * the note under the field can say it out loud rather than asking to be trusted.
