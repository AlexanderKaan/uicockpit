/**
 * WHAT SITS ON WHAT.
 *
 * Five kits in a row is a lie about how they are used. Nobody picks Tailwind
 * AND shadcn as two things — shadcn IS Tailwind, with components on top. And
 * nobody puts Bootstrap next to either: it brings its own everything.
 *
 * So there is a base and there are layers, and the rule is not typed here —
 * it is read from what each kit says about itself in kits/<id>.json:
 *
 *   layer: 'tokens'       variables and nothing else     → sits UNDER anything
 *   layer: 'utility'      no components, just the theme  → can carry others
 *   standalone: true      brings its own base            → IS the whole stack
 *   standalone: false     needs the utility base under it → a layer
 *
 * A tokens layer is the odd one and the reason this is read rather than typed.
 * Open Props ships no components at all, so it never renders anything — it sits
 * under whatever does, and your own CSS then agrees with the kit above it.
 *
 * Add a kit tomorrow and it sorts itself, because the fields come from the
 * kit's own package, not from an opinion of ours.

 * that BRING the Radix behaviour package, sit on the Tailwind engine, carry
 * their own tokens and give you components. Four different things, and the old
 * card called it one.
 *
 * Nothing here is decided: each kit's bands are read from its own package by
 * fetch-kits — what brings behaviour is what the package says it depends on.
 * Two kits in this tool declare the same one, which is the fact worth showing:
 * shadcn and Radix Themes both sit on radix-ui.
